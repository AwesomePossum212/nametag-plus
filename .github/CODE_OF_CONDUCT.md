# Code of Conduct

I'll keep this simple. I don't expect this project to need anything formal.
- Don't do anything that could make someone feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.
- Respect other's viewpoints and keep debates professional.
- Make every action here contributive and approriate.
  - Don't troll or add unrelated content. If it isn't related to the project, don't post it.
  - All content should be PG. Remember, this repository is intended for use by developers of all ages.
- Repository maintainers have the final say in what is against the rules.
- And of course, everything here should obey GitHub's ToS.
